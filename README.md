# MetaMask GitHub Meta Repository

This repository holds organization-wide configuration, documentation, and reusable workflow templates.

## What you need to do
- **Use the workflow templates**: Copy the files from `workflow-templates/` into your repo’s `.github/workflows/` directory and adjust inputs (e.g., node versions, release branches) as needed.
- **Keep org docs nearby**: Refer to `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` and `SECURITY.md` when contributing or reporting issues.
- **Profile content**: The organization profile shown on GitHub lives in `profile/README.md`; update it there if messaging needs to change.
