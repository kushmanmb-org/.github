# Multisig Wallet ABI Documentation

This directory contains the ABI (Application Binary Interface) definition for an Ethereum multisignature wallet smart contract.

## Files

- `multisig-wallet.abi.json` - Complete contract ABI with functions, events, and constructor

## Contract Overview

The multisignature wallet contract provides secure multi-owner administration with the following capabilities:

### Owner Management

- `addOwner(address _owner)` - Add a new owner to the wallet
- `removeOwner(address _owner)` - Remove an existing owner
- `changeOwner(address _from, address _to)` - Replace one owner with another
- `isOwner(address _addr)` - Check if an address is an owner (read-only)

### Transaction Execution

- `execute(address _to, uint256 _value, bytes _data)` - Submit a transaction for confirmation
- `confirm(bytes32 _h)` - Add your signature to a pending operation
- `revoke(bytes32 _operation)` - Withdraw your confirmation
- `hasConfirmed(bytes32 _operation, address _owner)` - Check if an owner has confirmed (read-only)

### Configuration

- `changeRequirement(uint256 _newRequired)` - Change the number of required signatures
- `setDailyLimit(uint256 _newLimit)` - Set the daily spending limit
- `resetSpentToday()` - Reset today's spending counter
- `kill(address _to)` - Destroy the contract and send remaining funds

### View Functions

- `m_numOwners()` - Get the number of owners (read-only)
- `m_required()` - Get the required number of signatures (read-only)
- `m_dailyLimit()` - Get the daily spending limit (read-only)

## Events

The contract emits the following events with indexed parameters for efficient filtering:

- `OwnerAdded(address indexed newOwner)`
- `OwnerRemoved(address indexed oldOwner)`
- `OwnerChanged(address indexed oldOwner, address indexed newOwner)`
- `Confirmation(address indexed owner, bytes32 indexed operation)`
- `Revoke(address indexed owner, bytes32 indexed operation)`
- `SingleTransact(address indexed owner, uint256 value, address indexed to, bytes data)`
- `MultiTransact(address indexed owner, bytes32 indexed operation, uint256 value, address indexed to, bytes data)`
- `ConfirmationNeeded(bytes32 indexed operation, address indexed initiator, uint256 value, address indexed to, bytes data)`
- `RequirementChanged(uint256 newRequirement)`
- `Deposit(address _from, uint256 value)`

## Deployment

When deploying the contract, the constructor requires:

- `address[] _owners` - Array of initial owner addresses
- `uint256 _required` - Number of required confirmations for transactions
- `uint256 _dailyLimit` - Maximum amount that can be spent per day without multi-sig

## Owner Address

**Primary Owner Address:** `0x6B834a2f2a24ae7e592AA0843aa2bDF58157bee7`

This address has full access and write functionality as an owner of the deployed multisig wallet.

## Usage with Web3

```javascript
const Web3 = require('web3');
const web3 = new Web3('YOUR_RPC_URL');

// Load ABI
const abi = require('./multisig-wallet.abi.json');

// Create contract instance
const contractAddress = 'YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS';
const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(abi, contractAddress);

// Example: Check if address is owner
const isOwner = await contract.methods.isOwner('0x6B834a2f2a24ae7e592AA0843aa2bDF58157bee7').call();
console.log('Is owner:', isOwner);

// Example: Get number of owners
const numOwners = await contract.methods.m_numOwners().call();
console.log('Number of owners:', numOwners);
```

## Security Considerations

- All owner management and configuration changes require multi-signature approval
- Daily spending limits can be set to allow single-owner transactions below the threshold
- Each transaction must be confirmed by the required number of owners before execution
- Owners can revoke their confirmations before a transaction is executed
